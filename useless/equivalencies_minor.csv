The course material has overlap with both MATH 254 and 255 but not enough to warrant equivalency. I would also be hesitant to give it a general MATH 2XX or 3XX equivalence since there would be double crediting issues for our Honours students. We could, on a case by case basis, consider such an equivalence for math major students. "
